CoinChute
=========

Pull payment platform for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin only supports push transactions, as in the buyer needs to initiate the payment via a program. This model does not work for recurring payments such as Spotify. CoinChute allows merchants to pull money from buyers via preauthorized transactions.
